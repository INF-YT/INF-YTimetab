============

INF-YTimetab is the Informatics-Young Team's rewrite of the University of
Edinburgh's [Timetab timetabling system](http://www.timetab.ed.ac.uk/).


About
-----

Part of the Informatics Young Team's [ILWHack-winning](http://data.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilwhack/) project of re-modelling the university's many portals into a single
[MyED 2."oh"](https://github.com/inf1yt/don) portal, the INF-YTimetable produces
a standard [ical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icalendar) calendar file from a
list of your courses, allowing you to import your lecture timetable into
almost any Calendar application, including Google Calendar, Outlook, and
probably that slide phone you've kept since 2006.

A bit better than an HTML page, non?
