INF-YTimetab
============

INF-YTimetab is the Informatics Young Team's rewrite of the University of
Edinburgh's [Timetab timetabling system](http://www.timetab.ed.ac.uk/).

It produces a standard [ical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icalendar)
calendar file from a list of your courses, allowing you to import your
lecture timetable into almost any Calendar application, including Google
Calendar, Outlook, and probably even that slide phone you've kept since 2006!


About
-----

INF-YTimetab is one component in the Informatics Young Team's
[ILWHack-winning](http://data.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilwhack/) project, illustrating
the awesome crossovers and mashups that could occur if the University opened
up its data sources.

So this is a bit better than an HTML page, non?
